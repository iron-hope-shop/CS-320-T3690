## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By following best practice when creating new applications I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure.  This includes creating unit, static, and dynamic testing in order to locally test the software before accumulating too much technical debt.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by meeting with a customer and outlining their requirements with them.  After that initial discussion I can take the requirements and create a minimum viable product to showcase functionality so that I may validate the software.

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with an omni-channel strategy.  First the requirements must be gathered and laid out.  Then a design must be created to outline the technical needs for the project.  After those steps I will create a minimum viable product and create tests to validate the requirements are met.
